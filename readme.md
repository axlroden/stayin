# WoW Classic TBC Auto login and stay in

To combat massive queues on raid day, you can remote into your home computer before queue goes crazy and start this.
This will check your Battle.net installation, and find the correct folders from its product.db file.
Then it will start the battle.net launcher and click play, wait for char select and enter the world.
On disconnects/reconnects it will auto rejoin the server.

# Future plans

One can keep in game, if you logout and change to another char every 55 mins (you get kicked after 60 mins).
Planning to do a simle /logout, and go 1 char down, and reenter.
This will probably not be super EULA friendly, as I will do automation in game.. but its all keyboard/mouse based so untraceable.# stayin
